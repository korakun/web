<p>Moon Lovers was one intense ride! It has everything you could ask for including action, romance, handsome princes,
    drama, and so much intensity. It’s an epic journey of one woman who must navigate her new life in the past
    surrounded by princes vying for her affections. Goryeo is also a very dangerous place, and when she gets caught in
    the middle of their battle for the throne, her life gets seriously complicated.

    I absolutely love the Goryeo era, and this drama didn’t disappoint in that regards. The costumes are so gorgeous for
    both the men and women. I also love the long flowing hair on the guys and the more intricate styles on the girls.
    The sets are completely beautiful, and they easily transported me right into the drama.
